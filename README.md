# VroidViewer
A *broken* demo to demonstrate VRMs being used with React Native.

## Status
**05/09/2024** - Running into multiple issues on android still. I believe most of the issues are coming from some incompatiblity with [three-vrm](https://github.com/pixiv/three-vrm). Honestly, we're better off using a game engine like Godot when targeting mobile. 

Still being experimented with. VRM1 models can be loaded and rendered, but VRM0 only renders an untextured face.

I still need to add a UI, animations, and expression control.

## Dev Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn` in main directory
3. Run `yarn start` to start dev server

This works with Expo go, so building isn't required.
